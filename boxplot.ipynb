    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This repository contains all of the files pertaining to my 2018 project submission for the Fundamentals of Data \n",
    "Analysis module of the GMIT H.Dip program in Data Analytics. All of the work within this repository was carried out over the course of a 4 week period in November and December 2018. This Jupyter notebook [1] contains the complete documentation for the project.\n",

    "### 1.1 Project Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this project is to investigte and explain boxplots and their uses, by researching the subject and then demonstrating the use of box plots using `matplotlib.pyplot`[2]. There are 4 main tasks to carried out [3]:\n",
    "* Summarise the history of the box plot and situations in which it used.\n",
    "* Demonstrate the use of the box plot using data of your choosing.\n",
    "* Explain any relevant terminology such as the terms quartile and percentile. \n",
    "* Compare the box plot to alternatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Plan for the project\n",
    "\n",
    "The plan for this project is as follows:\n",
    "1. Section 2 will give an a brief introduction to boxplots, looking at the history and the use cases. The theory behid them and technical terminology will be explained at this stage\n",
    "1. In Section 3 I will analyse a data set using boxplots, (insert data set here!)\n",
    "1. In Section 4 I will discuss some of the findings from Section 3, looking at alternatives to the boxplot, comparing and contrasting the relative strenghts of each approach\n",
    "1. The project will be concluded in Section 5\n",

    "### 2.1 Descriptive Statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "When a statistician or data analyst want to understand and compare datasets, they must have some way way to summarise the dataset. For a one dimensional data set, the data summary should have some idea of where the middle of the dataset lies, and also some measure of what the spread or distribution around this middle value is. A common measure for the middle of a dataset is the *mean*. The mean is calculated by summing the values in the dataset and diving by the number of items in the dataset [4]. The *standard deviation* gives an idea of the spread of the values in the set. The standard deviation is calculated by [5]:\n",
    "1. Subtracting each value in the data set from the mean\n",
    "1. Squaring each result\n",
    "1. Taking the average of these resultant squares\n",
    "1. Taking the square root of this value\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard deviation is in the same units as the original data.\n",

Outliers are extreme values that deviate from other observations in data [7]. If a dataset has outliers, the *five number summary summary* can be used to better describe it.\n",

    "### 2.2 The five number summary\n",
    "\n",
    "A different set of descriptive statistics that can be used to summarise a dataset is the *five number summary*. This chooses 5 numbers to help define the centre of the data, and also how well spread out they are [6]. The five numbers are:\n",
    "1. Minimum - the smallest value in the data set\n",

    "1. The corresponding value is the *k<sup>th</sup>* percentile\n",
    "1. Count the numbers in the data set until you get to the value indicated by step 2, the *k<sup>th</sup>* percentile is the average of that value and the value from the set that follows it\n",
    "\n",
    "Quartiles are special cases of percentiles:\n",
    "1. The first quartile, *Q<sub>1</sub>*, is equal to the 25<sup>th</sup> percentile\n",
    "1. The second quartile (known as the the *median*) is equal to the 50<sup>th</sup> percentile\n",
    "1. The third quartile, *Q<sub>3</sub>*, is equal to the 75<sup>th</sup> percentile\n",
    "\n",
    "The the difference between *Q<sub>3</sub>*, and *Q<sub>1</sub>* is known as the *inter-quartile range*, and can be used to give an indication of the spread of the data. The median is used as an estimate for the centre of the data. \n",

It was invented in the 1970s by American statistician John Wilder Tukey [11]. \n",
    "It is a compact distributional summary,  displaying less detail than a histogram or kernel density,  but also taking up less space.   Boxplots use robust summary statistics that are always located at actual data points and are quickly computable - even without a computer [12]. Over 40 years later, the box plot has become one of the most widely used statistical plots. In that time the box plot has been developed and enhanced, but Tukey's original box plot would have looked like this:\n",
